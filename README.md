# MAA
## 1. MMA's principles and roles in applications
## 2. How LLMs and VLMs enhance MAAs
### Agent AI types
1. Generalist Agent (GAs)
What is a truly valuable GA looks like?-> It is natural to interact with, and generalize to a board range of contexts and modalities.
2. Embodied Agents
Goal: The agents can learn to creatively solve challenging tasks, which including interacting with pyhiscal world.
Requirement:
  1. computer vision
  2. speech recognition
  3. NLP for langauge translation and image classification
  4. reinforcement learning-interactive tasks like game playing
3. Action Agents (gaming AI and robotics)
What can it do?-> execute physical actions in the simulated pyhsical environment or real world.
  Type 1: gaming AI: interact with game environment. NLP enable smooth communication between agents and humans.
  Type 2: robotics
